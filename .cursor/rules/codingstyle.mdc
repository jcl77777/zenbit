description: Coding Style Guidelines
When generating code:
✅ Write the absolute minimum required to complete the task
🧩 Keep code precise, modular, and testable
✅ Add unit tests as much as possible
❌ Make no sweeping changes or unrelated edits
✅ Never break existing functionality
⚠️ If I need to take manual steps (e.g., Supabase config), clearly call them out
✅ Use GitHub version control properly (commits should match each task)
